# Timbu Cloud Shop - Stage 2 Frontend Task

## Study Material

- Learn React and Next (Js/Ts)

## Task

In this stage, you'll step outside your individual coding zone and embrace collaboration! Here's the mission:

1. **Find a Designer**: Partner up with a designer. This is your chance to showcase your communication and teamwork skills.
2. **Design Implementation**: Collaborate with your designer to bring their Timbu Cloud shop page design to life. Translate the design into a functional webpage using React (.tsx/.jsx) or Next.js (.tsx/.jsx). Make sure thereâ€™s a checkout page as well.

## Requirements

1. **Collaboration**: Effective communication and teamwork with your assigned designer throughout the development process. (You are only allowed to collaborate with a designer; any collaboration with your fellow FE dev will result in instant disqualification).
2. **Technologies**: Typescript or JavaScript.
3. **Responsiveness**: The website must be responsive and function well on all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

### Key Features:

- The shop page should reflect the designer's vision.
- Products should be displayed with clear descriptions and images.
- A checkout page and checkout process should be implemented.
- There will be no functional checkout process at this stage.
- All static pages must be implemented.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Visual Design**: Your implementation must be pixel-perfect and reflect what is on the Figma design (layout, colors, branding).
2. **Product Display**: Products are displayed clearly with descriptions and images.
3. **Navigation**: Navigation allows users to browse through the shop page.
4. **Static Pages**: The page is static (no working checkout process).
5. **Responsiveness**: The page should be fully responsive and adjust to different screen sizes.
6. **Code Quality**: Well-structured, indented, and easy-to-read JSX/TSX code.

## Submission Mode

Submit your task through the designated submission form. Ensure you've:

1. Hosted the page on a platform of your choice (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).
2. Double-checked all requirements and acceptance criteria.
3. Provided the hosted page's URL in the submission form.
4. Provided a link to the Figma file of the design.
5. Thoroughly reviewed your work to ensure accuracy, functionality, and adherence to the specified guidelines before you submit it.

## Submission Deadline

The deadline for submissions is **Tuesday, 9 July, at 11:59 PM GMT**. Late submissions will not be entertained.
